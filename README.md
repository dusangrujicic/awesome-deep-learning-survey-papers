# Awesome- Deep Learning Related Survey Papers

In this page, I will provide a curated list of survey papers on topics related to deep learning and its applications in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, healthcare and more. 
Due to the large volume of works published in deep learning area, I try to keep track of comprehensive survey papers published (or under review) in top journals. 
If there is a paper missing here, please email me (at shervin.minaee@gmail.com) the paper title and journal, and I would be happy to include it in this list.

# Background

Deep learning models have been applied to various tasks/application from different areas in the past 8-9 years, and there are countless papers written on the applications of deep learning in different fields. 
With the maturity and rising number of deep learning works in different fields, people have started writing survey papers to provide a review of the most promising works in those topics.
